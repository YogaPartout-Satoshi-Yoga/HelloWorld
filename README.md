# HelloWorld
That is the TOC if one might say.  This is where everything started back in 2008
The title: YogaPartout-Satoshi.Yoga means that there are two web sites being combined.  One is in french (yogapartout.com) and the other is in english (satoshi.yoga).  We are a non profit organisation because the previous owner (Daniel Gauthier) wanted to give back to the world what the world has given him over the years.
By becoming visible on the English side of the world, it is now possible to offer what made us popular in the first place: WebCasts. We call it the 'UnConference'.  All the details, including our modus operandi can be found at this url: https://satoshi.yoga/Radio.  Yes, there is a minimal fee of 75$ CA that we ask for conducting our interviews.  As of april 2024, we made 143 interviews. Quite an accomplishment, isn't it!  Here are our coordinates to reach us: YogaPartout-Satoshi.Yoga - 6300 Avenue Auteuil, Suite 505, Brossard, QC, Canada, J4ZP2 In closing, you may want to cunsult this url as we are looking for guest speakers: https://satoshi.yoga/Call+for+Speakers+-+The+Satoshi-Yoga+UnConference
Looking forward
